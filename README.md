# Autolib Data Analysis 
## Introduction
### The project undertaken was an analysis of a dataset sampled from the company Autolib's database. Autolib was an electric car sharing company. The sample data analysed representes record entries of subscribers renting and returning electric cars during various times of day. The data contains record entries of the dates April 1st 2018 - April 9th 2018.
## Motivation
### My main motivation for undertaking this project was practice my recently acquired skills in cleaning and analysing data. I venture to learn more and polish my skills.
## Summary of analysis
### 1.Loading and previewing of data
### 2.Data cleaning
    ~ Validity - dropping of irrelevant columns, dropping of irrelevant rows, checking for typos.
    ~ Accuracy - checking that the values in the columns with their ranges specified are within that range.
    ~ Completeness - checking for missing values and determining what is to be done.
    ~ Consistency - checking for duplicate rows and getting rid of the duplicate column cars.
    ~ Uniformity - Standardization of the case column names.
### 3.Data analysis
#### In my data analysis I ventured to answer the following questions:
####  1. During what hour of the day did most people in Paris rent electric cars?
####  2. During what hour of the day did most subscribers return the bluecars?
####  3. Which station was most frequented by subscribers?
####  4. Which station was most frequented by subscibers during the established most popular hour of the day?
####  5. What postal code is most popular for picking up bluecars?
####  6. What postal code is most popular for picking up bluecars during the most hour of the day?
####  7. Does the most popular postal code match with that of the most popular station?
####  8. Does the most popular postal codes during the most popular hour match to that of the most popular station during that same hour?
### 4.Technologies used
#### - Jupyter notebooks
### 5.Setup
#### As the code was written in python language, it can run on any software compatible with python.
